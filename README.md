# Crypto-Info-App
Built a react app allows users to view the real‑time prices of various
cryptocurrencies. The app utilizes the axios library to make API calls to a
crypto data provider, which returns the current prices of the selected
cryptocurrencies. The app then uses the react‑chartjs‑2 library to display
the data in a visually appealing line chart, allowing users to easily track the
price movements of their chosen cryptocurrencies. The app is responsive
and can be used on any device, making it a convenient tool for crypto
enthusiasts to stay up‑to‑date on the latest market trends.
